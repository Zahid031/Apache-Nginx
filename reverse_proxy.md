# Understanding Nginx Reverse Proxy

This document explains the concept of a reverse proxy and how to configure one using Nginx, based on the provided `nginx.conf` file.

## What is a Reverse Proxy?

A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more web servers, intercepting requests from clients. Unlike a forward proxy, which sits in front of clients and forwards their requests to the internet, a reverse proxy sits in front of servers and forwards client requests to those servers.

To the client, the reverse proxy appears to be the origin server. The client sends a request to the reverse proxy, and the reverse proxy then decides where to forward the request. This provides an additional layer of abstraction and control, which offers several benefits.

### Core Benefits of a Reverse Proxy

*   **Load Balancing:** Distribute incoming traffic among several backend servers to improve performance and reliability.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Hide the IP addresses and characteristics of your backend servers, protecting them from direct attacks. A reverse proxy can also handle SSL termination.
*   **Caching:** Cache content from backend servers to reduce latency and the load on the origin servers. This is why you see `200` on the first request and `304` (Not Modified) on subsequent requests.
*   **SSL Termination:** Decrypt incoming SSL connections at the reverse proxy and send unencrypted requests to the backend servers. This offloads the SSL/TLS processing from the backend servers.
*   **URL Rewriting:** Change the URL of a request before it is forwarded to the backend server.

## Analyzing the `nginx.conf`

Here is a slightly modified and commented version of your Nginx configuration to make it easier to understand. The original configuration had two server blocks for the same `server_name`, which can be combined.

```nginx
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
    worker_connections 768;
    # multi_accept on;
}

http {
    ##
    # Basic Settings
    ##
    sendfile on;
    tcp_nopush on;
    types_hash_max_size 2048;
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    ##
    # SSL Settings
    ##
    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    ##
    # Logging Settings
    ##
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;

    ##
    # Gzip Settings
    ##
    gzip on;

    ##
    # Virtual Host Configs
    ##
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

    # This is the main server block that listens for incoming connections.
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name 35.173.231.106; # Your EC2 instance public IP

        # This location block handles requests for the root URL ("/").
        # It proxies the request to another EC2 instance.
        location = / {
            proxy_pass http://ec2-34-228-20-228.compute-1.amazonaws.com;
        }

        # This location block handles requests that start with "/py/".
        # It proxies the request to your PythonAnywhere application.
        location /py/ {
            proxy_pass https://zahid03.pythonanywhere.com/;
            
            # This header is important. It tells the PythonAnywhere server
            # what the original host was. Without this, the application
            # might not work correctly.
            proxy_set_header Host zahid03.pythonanywhere.com;
        }
    }
}
```

### Breakdown of the Configuration

1.  **`user www-data;`**: Sets the user for worker processes.
2.  **`worker_processes auto;`**: Nginx will automatically detect the number of available CPU cores and set the number of worker processes accordingly.
3.  **`events { ... }`**: This block contains directives that affect connection processing.
4.  **`http { ... }`**: This block contains directives for handling HTTP traffic.
5.  **`server { ... }`**: This defines a virtual server to handle requests.
    *   **`listen 80;`**: This tells Nginx to listen for incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP).
    *   **`server_name 35.173.231.106;`**: This specifies the server name, which is the public IP of your EC2 instance.
6.  **`location` blocks**: These are the core of the reverse proxy setup. They tell Nginx what to do with requests based on the URL.
    *   **`location = / { ... }`**: This handles requests for the exact URL `/`.
        *   **`proxy_pass http://ec2-34-228-20-228.compute-1.amazonaws.com;`**: This is the key directive. It tells Nginx to forward any request for `/` to your other EC2 instance.
    *   **`location /py/ { ... }`**: This handles any request where the URL starts with `/py/`.
        *   **`proxy_pass https://zahid03.pythonanywhere.com/;`**: This forwards the request to your PythonAnywhere application.
        *   **`proxy_set_header Host zahid03.pythonanywhere.com;`**: This is crucial. It sets the `Host` header in the request sent to the PythonAnywhere server. Many web applications use the `Host` header to determine how to route the request. Without this, your PythonAnywhere app might not know how to handle the incoming request.

## Caching: `200` vs `304` Status Codes

When you make a request for the first time, the server returns a `200 OK` status code, and the content is sent to your browser. Your browser then caches this content.

On subsequent requests for the same resource, your browser sends a request to the server with an `If-None-Match` or `If-Modified-Since` header. The server checks if the resource has changed.

*   If the resource **has not changed**, the server returns a `304 Not Modified` status code with an empty body. This tells the browser that it can use the version it has in its cache. This saves bandwidth and reduces latency.
*   If the resource **has changed**, the server returns a `200 OK` with the new content.

This behavior is typically controlled by the browser and the backend server, but a reverse proxy can also be configured to handle caching to further improve performance.

I hope this document helps you and others understand the power and simplicity of setting up a reverse proxy with Nginx!
